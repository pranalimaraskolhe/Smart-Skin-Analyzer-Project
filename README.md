# Smart-Skin-Analyzer-Project
A Raspberry Pi 3 device called a "smart skin analyser" uses a camera as a sensor to measure the moisture, oiliness, and texture of the skin. It offers tailored skincare advice. It assists physicians in efficiently guiding patients' skincare regimens by analysing data such as pore size and wrinkle depth. In order to follow the effects of various products and treatments, this device may also measure the health of the skin over time.

### The data set is taken from the website : <b>Kaggle</b>
